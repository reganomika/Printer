1. Make sure your printer is powered on and showing no error messages. Try restarting it to reset the connection.
2. Confirm that both your iPhone or iPad and the printer are connected to the same Wi-Fi network.
3. Check for low or empty supplies — ensure the printer has enough paper, ink, or toner.
4. Look for any alerts or error messages on the printer's display, and consult the user manual for specific troubleshooting steps.
5. Visit the manufacturer’s website to check for available firmware updates — even brand-new printers may need one.
6. Verify that your printer supports AirPrint, as not all models are compatible.
