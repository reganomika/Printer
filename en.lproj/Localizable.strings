4. Look for any alerts or error messages on the printer's display, and consult the user manual for specific troubleshooting steps.
5. Visit the manufacturer’s website to check for available firmware updates — even brand-new printers may need one.
6. Verify that your printer supports AirPrint, as not all models are compatible.
